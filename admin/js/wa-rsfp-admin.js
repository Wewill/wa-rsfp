// Code for your admin-facing JavaScript source should reside in this file.

// This enables you to define handlers for when the DOM is ready:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // DOM is fully loaded
    // Place your DOM-ready code here
});

// When the window is loaded:
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    // Window is fully loaded
    // Place your window-load code here
});

// Ideally, it is not considered best practice to attach more than a
// single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
// Although scripts in the WordPress core, Plugins, and Themes may be
// practicing this, we should strive to set a better example in our own work.
